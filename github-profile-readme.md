### 👋 About

I design and lead emotionally resonant interactive experiences—from vision to vessel, from concept to controller.

With 22+ years across AAA, VR, mobile, and live service platforms, I bring an empathetic, player-first design philosophy grounded in psychology, data-driven iteration, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.
